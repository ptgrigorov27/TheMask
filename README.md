Project topic: Developing a sentiment-based model to predict cryptocurrency price fluctuations

Project Overview: Crypto-currency is a digital currency designed to work as means of exchange through a computer network. In contrast with actual stocks, crypto-currency is a highly volatile and sentiment-driven form of investment, meaning that the demand for a particular crypto depends mostly on the overall attitude of investors towards it. Social media platforms such as Twitter are among the main sources where information about crypto sentiments can be extracted. The scope of the project is to use the free Twitter API to collect tweets over a given period of time and use this data to analyze the general sentiment about crypto-currency in order to predict their price fluctuations. In addition to that, the price movements of a crypto-currency (e.g. bitcoin) will be collected over that same period of time, and used along with the calculated sentiment scores from Twitter API to predict the price movement for the hours that follow. Data will be integrated from two different real-time sources, namely the Twitter API and a crypto-currency data provider such as CoinAPI. An additional potential scope for this project is using cloud capabilities to reliably collect real-time data over a longer time span.
